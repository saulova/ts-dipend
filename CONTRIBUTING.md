## Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors.  
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/saulova/ts-dipend/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development Setup

We recommend using [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) for a consistent development environment.

### Quick Setup

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
2. Install the **Dev Containers** extension in VS Code.
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saulova/ts-dipend.git
   cd ts-dipend
   ```
4. Open the repository folder in VS Code.
5. When prompted, **"Reopen in Container"**, or manually select:
   > **Command Palette (ctrl+shift+p or cmd+shift+p)** → **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

The container will automatically set up all dependencies and development tools for you!

### Available Scripts

Inside the DevContainer terminal:

- `task build-all` — build the project
- `task test-all` — run unit tests
- `task lint-all` — check code style
- `task --list-all` — list all available tasks
