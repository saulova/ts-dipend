      label: Feature Description
      description: Describe the feature you would like to see and why it is useful.
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        I'd like Dipend to support scoped lifetimes for services, so instances can be managed per scope rather than globally.

      label: Motivation
      description: Explain why this feature is important. What problem does it solve? What benefits does it bring?
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        In larger applications, global singletons are not always ideal. Scoped lifetimes would enable better resource management and isolation between requests.

      label: Possible Alternatives
      description: If you considered other solutions or workarounds, please share them.
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        I could manually manage instances per scope outside of Dipend, but it would be error-prone and duplicate logic.

      description: Add any other context or sketches (diagrams, examples) that could help explain your idea.

        Example:
        ```ts
        const dependencyContainer = new DependencyContainer();
        const scope = dependencyContainer.createScope();
        scope.addSingleton<MyService>();
        const myService = scope.getDependency<MyService>();
        ```
